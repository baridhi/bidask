# Pseudocode

This file provides the pseudocode to simplify implementations of [EDGE](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3892335) in any programming language. 

### Input

`O`, `H`, `L`, `C` vectors of Open, High, Low, and Close prices. The vectors must be sorted in ascending order of the timestamp.

### Output

Numeric spread estimate.

### Algorithm

2. Convert the `O`, `H`, `L`, `C` vectors to logs: `o = log(O)`, `h = log(H)`,  `l = log(L)`, `c = log(C)`
3. Compute the mid prices: `m = (h+l)/2`
4. Lag the vectors of one period: `c1 = lag(c)`, `m1 = lag(m)`, `h1 = lag(h)`, `l1 = lag(l)`
5. Compute the vector `x1 = (m-o)*(o-m1)+(m-c1)*(c1-m1)`
6. Compute the vector `x2 = (m-o)*(o-c1)+(o-c1)*(c1-m1)`
7. Compute the means `e1 = mean(x1)` and `e2 = mean(x2)`
8. Compute the variances `v1 = var(x1)` and `v2 = var(x2)`
9. Compute the weights `w1 = v2/(v1+v2)` and `w2 = v1/(v1+v2)`
9. Compute `k = 4*w1*w2`
10. Compute the fraction of times, for t = 2, ..., T, in which:
    1. the open equals the high `n1 = mean(o==h)`
    2. the open equals the low `n2 = mean(o==l)`
    3. the previous close equals the previous high `n3 = mean(c1==h1)`
    4. the previous close equals the previous low `n4 = mean(c1==l1)`
    5. the high price equals the low price and the previous close: `n5 = mean(h==l & l==c1)`
11. Compute the squared spread `s2 = -4*(w1*e1+w2*e2)/((1-k*(n1+n2)/2)+(1-n5)*(1-k*(n3+n4)/2))`
12. Return the spread `s = sqrt(max(0, s2))`

### Testing

To check the implementation is correct, import the data available at:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eguidotti/bidask/main/pseudocode/ohlc.csv

This file contains sample OHLC simulated price data to simplify testing. The data have been generated by simulating a price process as described in Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke (2021) with 390 trades per day and a 1% probability to observe a trade. The simulation uses a constant spread of 1%.

Run the estimation. You should obtain a spread estimate of **0.0100504050543988**. If you obtain a different results, you may use the following table to check and debug the intermediate steps.
